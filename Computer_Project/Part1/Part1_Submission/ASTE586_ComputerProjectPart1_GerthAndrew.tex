\section{Introduction}
This report details the methodology and solution used to complete the ASTE 586 Spacecraft and Attitude Dynamics Computer Project (Part 1). 

The goal of this project was to numerically integrate a given initial value problem and compare the approximated solution to an exact analytical solution.

The initial value problem was given as a linear system of four Ordinary Differential Equations:


\[
\vec{\dot{x}}(t) = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\dot{x_1}(t)\\
\dot{x_2}(t)\\
\dot{x_3}(t)\\
\dot{x_4}(t)
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
-2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 200 \\
0 & 0 & -200 & 0
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
x_1(t)\\
x_2(t)\\
x_3(t)\\
x_4(t)
\end{array}
\right]
\]


The initial values were given as:

\[
\vec{x}(0) = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
x_1(0) \\
x_2(0) \\
x_3(0) \\
x_4(0)
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 \\
0 \\
1 \\
0
\end{array}
\right]
\]

The numerical and analytical solutions were to be compared to at least $t = 10$, ultimately achieving a maximum allowed difference of $10^-3$ or less for all four components of $x$.

The final demonstration to assess the accuracy of the numerical solution was to plot $x^2_1(t) + x^2_2(t) + x^2_3(t) + x^2_4(t) - 2$ versus time to demonstrate the result is very close to zero.



\section{Analytical Solution}
To solve the initial value problem, I recognized it was given in the form $\frac{d}{dt}\vec{x}(t) = [A]\vec{x}(0)$, which has a solution of $\vec{x}(t) = e^{At}\vec{x}(0)$.

To find $e^{At}$ I found the eigenvalues of $A$ by solving $det(A-\lambda I) = 0$ for $\lambda$. This resulted in 4 eigenvalues:



\[
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\lambda_{1,2} \\
\lambda_{3,4}
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\pm 2i \\
\pm 200i
\end{array}
\right]
\]

Next I solved $(A - \lambda_iI)\vec{v}_i = \vec{0}$  to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.

\[
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\vec{v}_1\\
\vec{v}_2\\
\vec{v}_3\\
\vec{v}_4
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\left[1, i, 0, 0\right] \\
\left[1, -i, 0, 0\right] \\
\left[0, 0, 1, i\right] \\
\left[0, 0, 1, -i\right]
\end{array}
\right]
\]



Using the general solution of the form:\\
\[
\vec{x}(t) = c_1e^{\lambda_1t}\vec{v_1} + c_2e^{\lambda_2t}\vec{v_2} + c_3e^{\lambda_3t}\vec{v_3} + c_4e^{\lambda_4t}\vec{v_4}
\]

Next substitute the corresponding eigenvectors and eigenvalues:\\

\[
\vec{x}(t) = c_1e^{2it}
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 \\ i \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{array}
\right]
+ c_2e^{-2it}
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 \\ -i \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{array}
\right]
+ c_3e^{200it}
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ i
\end{array}
\right]
+ c_4e^{-200it}
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ -i
\end{array}
\right]
\]



\[
\vec{x}(t) = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
c_1e^{2it} + c_2e^{-2it}\\
ic_1e^{2it} - ic_2e^{-2it}\\
c_3e^{200it} + c_4e^{-200it}\\
ic_3e^{200it} - ic_2e^{-200it}\\
\end{array}
\right]
\]


Use Euler's Formula: \\
\[
e^{i\omega t} = cos(\omega t) + isin(\omega t)
\]
\[
\vec{x}(t) = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
 A_1cos(2t) + A_2sin(2t) \\ 
 -A_1sin(2t) + A_2cos(2t) \\
 A_3cos(200t) + A_4sin(200t) \\
-A_3sin(200t) + A_4cos(200t)
\end{array}
\right]
\]

	where\\

\[
\vec{A} = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
c_1 + c_2 \\
 i(c_1 - c_2)\\
 c_3 + c_4\\
 i(c_3 - c_4)\\
\end{array}
\right]
\]



Now to solve for the coefficient vector $\vec{A}$, evaluate at the initial condition $t = 0$.

$\vec{A} = [1, 0, 1, 0]$

This gives the analytical solution to the linear system of equations:



\[
\vec{x}(t) = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
 cos(2t)  \\
 -sin(2t)  \\
 cos(200t)  \\
 -sin(200t)
\end{array}
\right]
\]


\section{Numerical Integration}
My numerical integrations strategy was to use an already-built method of the Python library \verb!scipy!. This allowed me to minimize scripting, debugging, and testing time. 

The \verb!scipy.integrate.solve_ivp()! function allows for many different numerical integration methods and tolerances to be used. I chose the Runge-Kutta45 method and specified desired relative and absolute tolerances of $10^{-8}$. This combination ensured the solver met the specified accuracy from the problem statement while not being too computationally expensive.

\section{Plotting and Comparing Results}
Due to the linear system containing different orders of effects $x_1$ and $x_2$ on different order of magnitude than $x_3$ and $x_4$, I chose to create two sets of plots with different "step sizes" for clarity.
Figure 1 shows four plots.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Analytical Solution evaluated from $t = [0, 10]$ with step size of $0.100$.
\item Numerical Solution evaluated from $t = [0, 10]$ with step size of $0.100$.
\item Absolute Error (defined as $x_{analytical}(t) - x_{numerical}(t)$) for the same range and step size.
\item The result of $x^2_1(t) + x^2_2(t) + x^2_3(t) + x^2_4(t) - 2$ for the same range and step size.
\end{enumerate}

Figure 1 shows that the numerical solution is within the tolerances specified in the problem statement, but it does not show an accurate representation for the $x_3$ and $x_4$ terms due to the relatively large step size.

Figure 2 contains the same set of four plots, but evaluated from $t = [0, 10]$ with step size of $0.00001$. The plots are then only shown from $t = [9.9, 10.0]$ as this is the most interesting region due to the highest amount of propagation error.

%![[ASTE586_ComputerProject_Part1_Plot2.pdf]]

These four plots show the behavior of $x_3$ and $x_4$ much more accurately and serve as a good final confirmation that the goal of the computer project has been satisfied.

The maximum absolute error (*note all maximum errors do not occur at the same value of $t$):

$x_1: 7.550\times10^{-15}$\\
$x_2: 7.661\times10^{-15}$\\
$x_3: 1.193\times10^{-05}$\\
$x_4: 1.194\times10^{-05}$

The tolerance based on $x^2_1(t) + x^2_2(t) + x^2_3(t) + x^2_4(t) - 2$ was: 

$[-2.340\times10^{-05}, \space \space 2.346\times10^{-09}]$

\section{Conclusion}
The initial value problem was solved analytically and numerically. The accuracy of the numerical solver met the requirements and is also easily tuned for different required accuracies within the method.
